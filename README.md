## Description
The Halloween Project is a fun and interactive application project that was created for Clio Hackathon October 2024.
For this project we used Arduinos to create various interactive halloween themed elements.


## Trick or Treat box
The Trick or Treat Box is an exciting and mysterious element of our Halloween Project.  
Will you get a treat, or will you be tricked? The box is equipped with sensors and a mechanism that can dispense
candy or trigger a spooky surprise. Perfect for adding an element of suspense and fun to your Halloween festivities!
Code and schematic can be found here: [Trick or Treat Box](trick_or_treat)


## Rocking Chair with a doll sitting on it that moves its head
Imagine a spooky old rocking chair with a creepy doll sitting on it, slowly rocking back and forth. 
The doll's head is activated by a motion sensor. When you approach the chair, the doll's head will turn towards you 
and turn back. The doll will then continue rocking back and forth, waiting for the next unsuspecting victim to approach.
