## Description
The Halloween Project is a fun and interactive application project that was created for Clio Hackathon October 2024.
For this project we used Arduinos to create various interactive halloween themed elements.


## Trick or Treat box
The Trick or Treat Box is an exciting and mysterious element of our Halloween Project.  
Will you get a treat, or will you be tricked? The box is equipped with sensors and a mechanism that can dispense
candy or trigger a spooky surprise. Perfect for adding an element of suspense and fun to your Halloween festivities!


## Rocking Chair with a doll sitting on it that moves its head
Imagine a spooky old rocking chair with a creepy doll sitting on it, slowly rocking back and forth. 
The doll's head is activated by a motion sensor. When you approach the chair, the doll's head will turn to follow you.
